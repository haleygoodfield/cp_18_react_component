#  React Environment & Component Basics
This is my eighteenth coding project using **Vite** to set up a **new React app** to **create a custom React component**. 
The project consists of two tasks: 
+ Task 1: Create a New Component
+ Task 2: Use the Component

This is my first step into building modern front-end interfaces with React!
